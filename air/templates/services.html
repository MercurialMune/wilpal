		<p>FCL shipping is the most efficient and cost effective container shipping method.
 <span id="stuff3" class="hide">FCL involves one shipper and one consignee – meaning you do not share space in the container with other shippers. 
		In order to simplify the process and reduce risk, many shippers choose to ship FCL while not actually filling the container to capacity.
		 A typical door-to-door FCL shipping process includes: 
		• Transporting the empty container from the container yard 
		• Loading the container at the shipper’s facility 
		• Transporting the container via truck or rail to the departure port
		• Shipping the container to the destination port 
		• Delivering the container to its final destination </span></p>

<span id="stuff2" class="hide">less-than-container load shipping.  LCL refers to consolidated shipments of loose cargo that are typically boxed, palletized or crated.
		LCL is typically cheaper due to the cost of the full container being shared between multiple shippers – however, 
		the rate per equivalent weight of an LCL shipment will be much higher than a full container load (FCL). 
		Despite sharing a container with other shippers,
		LCL still allows visibility and control over your cargo. </span></p>
